# SanityImgFluid

This is a helper component which abstracts loading gatsby-image from Sanity image's Asset ID. This is built to be primarily used with block components that are being laid out using `_rawContent` fields from Sanity. Please use the standard `<Img>` tag from `gatsby-imge` and querying data from graphql manually for images not incoming from `_rawContent` queries.
